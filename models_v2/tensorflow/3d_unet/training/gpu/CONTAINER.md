# TensorFlow UNet-3D Training

## Description 
This document has instructions for running UNet-3D training with BFloat16 and FP32 precisions using Intel® Extension for TensorFlow on Intel® Data Center GPU Max Series.

## Datasets

Download the dataset by registering on [Brain Tumor Segmentation 2019 dataset](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/brats-2019/). After downloading dataset, follow steps in the [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/TensorFlow/Segmentation/UNet_3D_Medical#quick-start-guide) to pre-process the dataset in tfecords format. 

Set the `DATASET_DIR` to point to the TF records directory when running UNet-3D training. 

## Quick Start Scripts

| Script name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `run_model.sh` | Runs BFloat16 and FP32 Training on single and two tiles |

Requirements:

* Host has [Intel® Data Center GPU Max Series](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/series/232874/intel-data-center-gpu-max-series.html)
* Host has installed latest Intel® Data Center GPU Max Series [Drivers](https://dgpu-docs.intel.com/driver/installation.html)
* Docker

### Docker pull command:

```bash
docker pull intel/image-segmentation:tf-max-gpu-unet-3d-training
```
The UNet-3D training container includes scripts, model and libraries needed to run BFloat16/FP32 Training. To run the quickstart scripts using this container, you'll need to provide volume mounts of the Brain Tumor Segmentation dataset. You will also need to provide an output directory to store logs.

```bash
#Required
export DATASET_DIR=<provide path to pre-processed dataset>
export PRECISION=<provide either bfloat16 or fp32 precision>
export MULTI_TILE=<provide True for multi-tile training, False for single-tile training>
export OUTPUT_DIR=<provide path to output logs directory>
SCRIPT=run_model.sh

#Optional
export BATCH_SIZE=<provide batch size. Otherwise default is 1>
IMAGE_NAME=intel/image-segmentation:tf-max-gpu-unet-3d-training

docker run -it \
--device /dev/dri \
--env BATCH_SIZE=${BATCH_SIZE} \
--env MULTI_TILE=${MULTI_TILE} \
--env DATASET_DIR=${DATASET_DIR} \
--env PRECISION=${PRECISION} \
--env OUTPUT_DIR=${OUTPUT_DIR} \
--env http_proxy=${http_proxy} \
--env https_proxy=${https_proxy} \
--env no_proxy=${no_proxy} \
--volume ${DATASET_DIR}:${DATASET_DIR} \
--volume /dev/dri:/dev/dri \
--volume ${OUTPUT_DIR}:${OUTPUT_DIR} \
${IMAGE_NAME} \
/bin/bash $SCRIPT
```
