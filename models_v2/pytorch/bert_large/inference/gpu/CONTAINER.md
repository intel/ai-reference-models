# Running BERT Large inference on Intel® Data Center GPU Max Series using Intel® Extension for PyTorch*

## Description

This document has instructions for running BERT Large Inference with FP16, BF16 and FP32 precisions using Intel® Extension for PyTorch on Intel® Max Series GPU. 


## Requirements
| Item | Detail |
| ------ | ------- |
| Host machine  | [Intel® Data Center GPU Max Series](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/series/232874/intel-data-center-gpu-max-series.html) |
| Drivers | GPU-compatible drivers need to be installed: Download [Driver](https://dgpu-docs.intel.com/driver/installation.html) |
| Software | Docker* |

## Quick Start Scripts

| Script name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `run_model.sh` |  BERT Large FP16, BF16 and FP32 inference on single or multiple GPU devices |

## Datasets

### SQuAD dataset

Download the [SQuAD 1.0 dataset](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/v4.0.0/examples/question-answering#fine-tuning-bert-on-squad10).
Set the `DATASET_DIR` to point to the directory where the files are located before running the BERT quickstart scripts. Your dataset directory should look something
like this:
```bash
<DATASET_DIR>/
├── dev-v1.1.json
├── evaluate-v1.1.py
└── train-v1.1.json
```
The setup assumes the dataset is downloaded to the current directory. 

## Pre-trained Model

Download the `config.json` and fine tuned model from huggingface and set the `BERT_WEIGHT` environment variable to point to the directory that has both files:

```bash
mkdir squad_large_finetuned_checkpoint
wget -c https://huggingface.co/bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad/resolve/main/config.json -O squad_large_finetuned_checkpoint/config.json
wget -c https://huggingface.co/bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad/resolve/main/pytorch_model.bin  -O squad_large_finetuned_checkpoint/pytorch_model.bin
wget -c https://huggingface.co/bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad/resolve/main/tokenizer.json -O squad_large_finetuned_checkpoint/tokenizer.json
wget -c https://huggingface.co/bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad/resolve/main/tokenizer_config.json -O squad_large_finetuned_checkpoint/tokenizer_config.json
wget -c https://huggingface.co/bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad/resolve/main/vocab.txt -O squad_large_finetuned_checkpoint/vocab.txt

BERT_WEIGHT=$(pwd)/squad_large_finetuned_checkpoint
```

## Docker pull Command

```bash
docker pull intel/language-modeling:pytorch-max-gpu-bert-large-inference
```

The BERT Large inference container includes scripts, models,libraries needed to run inference To run the `fp16_inference_plain_format.sh` quick start script follow the instructions below.

```bash
#Optional
export PRECISION=<provide FP16 ,BF16 or FP32,otherwise (default:BF16)>
export BATCH_SIZE=<provide batch size,otherwise (default: 256)>
export NUM_ITERATIONS=<provide num_iterations,otherwise (default: -1)>

#Required
export MULTI_TILE=<provide True for multi-tile GPU such as Max 1550, and False for single-tile GPU such as Max 1100>
export NUM_DEVICES=<provide the number of GPU devices used for inference. If it is larger than 1, the script launches multi-instance inference, where 1 instance launched on each GPU device simultaneously. It must be equal to or smaller than the number of GPU devices attached to each node. For GPU with 2 tiles, such as Max 1550 GPU, the number of GPU devices in each node is 2 times the number of GPUs, so `<num_devices>` can be set as <=16 for a node with 8 Max 1550 GPUs. While for GPU with single tile, such as Max 1100 GPU, the number of GPU devices available in each node is the same as number of GPUs, so `<num_devices>` can be set as <=8 for a node with 8 single-tile GPUs.>
export DATASET_DIR=<path to dataset>
export OUTPUT_DIR=<path to output log files>
export BERT_WEIGHT=$(pwd)/squad_large_finetuned_checkpoint
export PLATFORM=Max
