# Running BERT Large Training on Intel® Data Center GPU Max Series using Intel® Extension for PyTorch*

## Description
This document has instructions for running BERT Large training using BF16,TF32 and FP32 precisions using Intel® Extension for PyTorch on Intel Max Series GPU. 

## Quick Start Scripts
| Script name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `run_model.sh` | Runs BERT Large training on single or multiple GPU devices |

## Requirements
| Item | Detail |
| ------ | ------- |
| Host machine  | [Intel® Data Center GPU Max Series](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/series/232874/intel-data-center-gpu-max-series.html)  |
| Drivers | GPU-compatible drivers need to be installed: Download [Driver](https://dgpu-docs.intel.com/driver/installation.html) |
| Software | Docker* |

## Datasets
### Download and Extract the Dataset
Refer to the [link](README.md#dataset) to download and prepare dataset for training. Set `DATASET_DIR` to point to the dataset directory. 

## Docker pull Command
```
docker pull intel/language-modeling:pytorch-max-gpu-bert-large-training
```

The BERT Large training container includes scripts, models,libraries needed to run BF16,TF32 and FP32 training. To run the `run_model.sh` script, you will need to provide an output directory where log files will be written. 

```bash
#optional
export PRECISION=<provide FP32,TF32 or BF16 otherwise, (default: BF16)>
export NUM_ITERATIONS=<provide num_iterations,otherwise (default: 10)>
export BATCH_SIZE=<provide batch size,otherwise (default: 16)>

#required
export OUTPUT_DIR=<path to output directory>
export DATASET_DIR=<path to dataset directory>
export MULTI_TILE=<provide True for multi-tile GPU such as Max 1550, and False for single-tile GPU such as Max 1100>
export NUM_DEVICES=<provide the number of GPU devices used for training. It must be equal to or smaller than the number of GPU devices attached to each node. For GPU with 2 tiles, such as Max 1550 GPU, the number of GPU devices in each node is 2 times the number of GPUs, so it can be set as <=16 for a node with 8 Max 1550 GPUs. While for GPU with single tile, such as Max 1100 GPU, the number of GPU devices available in each node is the same as number of GPUs, so it can be set as <=8 for a node with 8 Max 1100 GPUs.>
export PLATFORM=Max
