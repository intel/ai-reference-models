## Description

Intel® Distribution for Python* (core packages) is a binary distribution of Python interpreter and commonly used packages for computation and data intensive domains, such as scientific and engineering computing, big data, and data science. The product supports Python 3.7 for Windows and Linux.  The product simplifies Python installation by providing packages in a binary form so that everything is preconfigured and no compilation tools are needed, as well as contains all the dependences for running on popular OS platforms. Python packages have been accelerated with Intel® Performance Libraries, including Intel® Math Kernel Library (Intel® MKL), Intel® Threading Building Blocks (Intel® TBB), Intel® Integrated Performance Primitives (Intel® IPP), and Intel® Data Analytics Acceleration Library (Intel® DAAL). The packages have been optimized to take advantage of parallelism through the use of vectorization, multi-threading and multi-processing, as well as through the use of optimized communication across multiple nodes.

Includes the Python3 interpreter, Conda, and the following core packages:
- Numpy
- Scipy
- oneMKL
- oneTBB
