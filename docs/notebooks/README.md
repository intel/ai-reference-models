# Jupyter Notebooks
  
This directory contains sample notebooks that demonstrate usage of the Model Zoo for Intel Architecture in Jupyter.
These notebooks are intended as examples and are not guaranteed to work for the latest version of Tensorflow and/or Model Zoo.
The contributor is responsible for maintaining their notebooks.
