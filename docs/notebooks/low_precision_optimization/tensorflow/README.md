# Quantizing a Pre-trained Model from Model Zoo for Intel® Architecture with Intel® Neural Compressor


## Background

Low-precision inference can speed up inference, by converting the fp32 model to int8 or bf16 model. Intel provides Intel® Deep Learning Boost technology in the Second Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors and newer Xeon®, which supports to speed up int8 and bf16 model by hardware.

Intel® Neural Compressor helps the user to simplify the processing to convert the fp32 model to int8/bf16.

At the same time, Intel® Neural Compressor will tune the quanization method to reduce the accuracy loss, which is a big blocker for low-precision inference.

Intel® Neural Compressor is released in Intel® AI Analytics Toolkit and works with Intel® Optimization of TensorFlow*.

## Purpose

Demostrate how to quantize a pre-trained model from Model Zoo for Intel(R) Architecture with Intel® Neural Compressor and show the performance gain after quantization.

We will learn the acceleration of AI inference by Intel AI technology:

1. Intel® Deep Learning Boost

2. Intel® Neural Compressor

3. Intel® Optimization for Tensorflow*

## How to Run

### Start running Jupyter Notebook


Steps:

```
./run_jupyter.sh 

(tensorflow) xxx@yyy:$ [I 09:48:12.622 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: 
...
[I 09:48:12.622 NotebookApp] Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4 is running at:
[I 09:48:12.622 NotebookApp] http://yyy:8888/?token=<token>
[I 09:48:12.622 NotebookApp]  or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=<token>
[I 09:48:12.622 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
[C 09:48:12.625 NotebookApp] 
    
    To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        ...
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://yyy:8888/?token=<token>
     or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=<token>
[I 09:48:26.128 NotebookApp] Kernel started: bc5b0e60-058b-4a4f-8bad-3f587fc080fd, name: python3
```

### Open Jupyter Notebook

Open link: **http://yyy:8888** in a web browser and enter the token generated during Jupyter startup. Click 'inc_for_tensorflow.ipynb'.

### Choose Kernel

Choose the env_inc kernel in the menu: Kernel -> Change kernel -> env_inc

### Run

Run all the cells in Jupyter Notebook one by one.

## Unit Test

Please prepare the ImageNet validation dataset and save it into **tf_2012_val** folder.

Execute `./ut.sh` to run unit tests.

It returns 0 if there is no error.
