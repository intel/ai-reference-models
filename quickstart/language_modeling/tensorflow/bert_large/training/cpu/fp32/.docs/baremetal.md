<!--- 50. Bare Metal -->
## Bare Metal

To run on bare metal, the following prerequisites must be installed in your environment:
* Python 3
* [intel-tensorflow>=2.5.0](https://pypi.org/project/intel-tensorflow/)
* numactl
* git

Once the above dependencies have been installed, download and untar the model
package, set environment variables, and then run a quickstart script. See the
[datasets](#datasets) and [list of quickstart scripts](#quick-start-scripts) for more
details on the different options. If switching between running squad and
classifier training or running classifier multiple times, use a new empty
`OUTPUT_DIR` to prevent incompatible checkpoints from getting picked up.

The snippet below shows a quickstart script running with a single instance:
```
wget <package url>
tar -xvf <package name>
cd <package dir>

CHECKPOINT_DIR=<path to the pretrained bert model directory>
DATASET_DIR=<path to the dataset being used>
OUTPUT_DIR=<directory where checkpoints and log files will be saved>
# For a custom batch size, set env var `BATCH_SIZE` or it will run with a default value.
export BATCH_SIZE=<customized batch size value>

# Run a script for your desired usage
./quickstart/<script name>.sh
```

To run distributed training (one MPI process per socket) for better throughput,
set the `MPI_NUM_PROCESSES` var to the number of sockets to use. Note that the
global batch size is mpi_num_processes * train_batch_size and sometimes the learning
rate needs to be adjusted for convergence. By default, the script uses square root
learning rate scaling.

For fine-tuning tasks like BERT, state-of-the-art accuracy can be achieved via
parallel training without synchronizing gradients between MPI workers. The
`mpi_workers_sync_gradients=[True/False]` var controls whether the MPI
workers sync gradients. By default it is set to "False" meaning the workers
are training independently and the best performing training results will be
picked in the end. To enable gradients synchronization, set the
`mpi_workers_sync_gradients` to true in BERT options. To modify the bert
options, modify the quickstart .sh script or call the `launch_benchmarks.py`
script directly with your preferred args.

To run with multiple instances, these additional dependencies will need to be
installed in your environment:
* openmpi-bin
* openmpi-common
* openssh-client
* openssh-server
* libopenmpi-dev
* horovod==0.19.1
