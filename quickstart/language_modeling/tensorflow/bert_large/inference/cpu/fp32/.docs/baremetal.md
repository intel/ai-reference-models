<!--- 50. Bare Metal -->
## Bare Metal

To run on bare metal, the following prerequisites must be installed in your environment:
* Python 3
* [intel-tensorflow>=2.5.0](https://pypi.org/project/intel-tensorflow/)
* numactl
* git

Once the above dependencies have been installed, download and untar the model
package, set environment variables, and then run a quickstart script. See the
[datasets](#datasets) and [list of quickstart scripts](#quick-start-scripts) 
for more details on the different options.

The snippet below shows how to run a quickstart script:
```
wget <package url>
tar -xvf <package name>
cd <package dir>

DATASET_DIR=<path to the dataset being used>
OUTPUT_DIR=<directory where log files will be saved>
# For a custom batch size, set env var `BATCH_SIZE` or it will run with a default value.
export BATCH_SIZE=<customized batch size value>

# Run a script for your desired usage
./quickstart/<script name>.sh
```
